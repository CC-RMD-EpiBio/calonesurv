# Prevalence-reweighted Kaplan Meier curves

This repository is an implmentation of a test statistic found by computing the area between cohort-weighted Kaplan-Meier curves. 
The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is used to compute p-values. The manuscript describing this statistic
is currently under review at RSOS. Here is an arXiv version: [arXiv1701.02424](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02424)
